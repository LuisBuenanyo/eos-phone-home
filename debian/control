Description: send "I am alive" ping to Canonical
 This package installs a daily cron job for surveying how many original OEM
 installs are running in the world. Note that this does not send any
 user specific data; it only transmits the operating system version
 (/var/lib/ubuntu_dist_channel), the machine product name, and a counter how
 many pings were sent.
