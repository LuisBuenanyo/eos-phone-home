canonical-census (0.3.1) precise; urgency=low

  * source /scripts/casper-functions after the prereqs argument in the
    46disable_census script.  This avoids warnings when updating initramfs
    (LP: #1065574).

canonical-census (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * send-census: Verify that the census page delivers "OK", as opposed to some
    error messages, proxy pages, etc.
  * sendd-census: Make sure that we can write the counter file. Otherwise, if
    writing fails after we already sent the ping, we'd send a perpetual series
    of zeros.
